\section{Questions}
Some general and more specific questions:
\bn
\item Is intro of internal module algebra important, as this construct is never used (here, it is used in \cite{Heid13}).
\item Why is completion of $K[[t]] \otimes A[[w]]$, wrt $\left<w\right>$-adic topology, important?
\item What is $\trm{Ume}(K/k)(A)$ if $N(A) = \{0\}$ (should be trivial group)? Not an answer, but nilpontency is important such that composition is well-def:

\item What is a PV-ring $R$ in the context of for (implicit/explicit) non-linear diff. equation $F \subset k\{u\}$ (with $\trm{char} k = 0$)?\\
Should be something like:
$$R \simeq S^{-1}_x k\{u\}/I(F) := S^{-1}_x k\{u\}/\left<\partial^i f : i \in \nz_0, f \in F\right>,$$
where $x \in \left<u_i\right> \bsl \{0\}$.
\item What is $\partial (\det X)$ for $L = \partial^2 - a \in k[\partial]$ if $a \in k\bsl k^\partial$ and $X \in \trm{Gl}_2(R)$ fundamental matrix?\\
Should be zero, however, direct computation shows $\partial \det X = \partial(a) x_1^2$.
\item For a differential field $(k,\partial)$ and its ring of differential operators $k[\partial] \subset \trm{End}_{C_k}(k)$, the module structure map $\Psi \in \trm{Hom}_{C_k}(k[\partial] \otimes k,k)$ is only $C_k$-linear. Hence, all tensors must be understood as $\otimes_{C_k}$.
%\item Invarance in PV-theory is not clear, is $\F
