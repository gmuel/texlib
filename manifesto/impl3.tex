\section{Implementation}
This section is going to discuss the implementation details of a functorial approach.
\subsection{Dependencies and inheritance}
As we have outlined before a direct inheritance tree encoding all mathematical dependencies can become quite steep and therefore prohibitively expensive in case of copy construction etc. Thus, the inheritance tree is thought of as a super object containing the actual mathematical objects:
\begin{lstlisting}[frame=single]
template<typename T1, ... >
struct math_concept {//something like group concept, ring concept, ...
//impl. details
};

\end{lstlisting}
